# Dummpy project to let you safely mess with git

## Why?
I seem to do fine working with git on my own projects; in a team
situation I get worried I'll screw up and destroy someone elses work.

This dummpy project lets the team clone, fork, pull and push, merge  without
having to worry about the consequences. Hopefully the chaos will create
help us all learn more about how GIT works under the hood.
