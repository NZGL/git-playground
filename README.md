# Dummpy project to let you safely mess with git

## Why?
I feel pretty confortable using git on my own projects, but in a team
situation I get worried I'll screw up someone elses work.  

This dummpy project lets the team clone, fork, pull and push, merge  without
having to worry about the consequences. Hopefully the choas will create
issues that will help us all learn more about how GIT works under the hood.
